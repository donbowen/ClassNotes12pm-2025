    "1. The obvious limitation is \"what if the relationships we find are different for smaller firms outside the S&P500\"? This is a good concern, and worthy of discussion in your results. Do you have an **economic argument** for why your particular relationships would be more or less relevant for small firms (than for the larger firms in the S&P500)? Depending on your answer, that means a relationship you find might be too high or too low. Maybe the sign of the relationship flips. \n",
    "1. Making sure we get the 2022 list of S&P500 firms. We do this by adjusting the URL to use the wiki page as of year end 2022. **As a result of this, we have 2022 tickers, which can cause problems:** If firms go private, fail, are acquired, or change their ticker between 2022 and now, then (A) our SEC scraper might not find the filings for that firm and (B) we might struggle to link the filings to other datasets like CRSP and Compustat.**To avoid this, we will tell the scraper to search for firms using their CIK**\n",
